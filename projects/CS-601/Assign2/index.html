                        My name is Alvaro Ching. I graduated in 2008 from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I'm currently a graduate student at Boston University to persue a masters degree in Computer Information System with concentration in Web Application Development. Also by persuing this degree i would like to learn new skills that will help me improve professionally and personally. Besides being a part-time student, I enjoy taking classes only through Coursera, Code Academy and Udacity to learn new programming skills. Previously I held an internship with the City of Cudahy as a Webmaster assistant and Disney Consumer Products IT and worked as a Document Imaging Specialist at AMI among others.
