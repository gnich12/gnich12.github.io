            <p>
                The City of Cudahy is located Southeast Los Angeles next to the L.A. River. I started internship at the City of Cudahy on November 2011 through December 2012. While being on this internship I have had the opportunity to assist the cityâ€™s website webmaster by updating and creating new content. This internship has also helped me put in practice my HTML and CSS skills and learn new skills such as vbscript and classic asp.

            <p>
                One of my task is to create new content such as new webpages, add content to existing webpages among others. To maintain consistency I used everything that was already available such as css classes, other webpages, etc.
